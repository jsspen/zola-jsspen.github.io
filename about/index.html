    In the Spring of 2020 I was working in the curatorial office of a beloved
    art museum and by the end of the year I was gearing up to embark on a new
    journey as a junior developer at a fast-growing startup. The onset of a
    global pandemic presented me with an unexpected opportunity to pivot,
    leading me to plunge headfirst into the realm of programming.
  </p>
  <p class="justify-text">
    I enrolled in a rigorous full stack coding bootcamp and graduated with my
    first job offers already in hand. Since then, Iâ€™ve accumulated substantial
    on-the-job experience in both frontend and backend development, with a
    primary focus on JavaScript frameworks, APIs, and cloud services. These
    skills have been complemented by the foundational knowledge I acquired
    during my bootcamp training.
  </p>
  <p class="justify-text">
    My diverse professional background spans project management, library and
    information science (across public, academic, and archival sectors), film
    production, grant writing, and publishing, with a strong emphasis on
    non-profit work. This breadth of experience has shaped my holistic
    perspective on problem-solving and has honed my adaptability in diverse
    environments. I take pride in my flexibility, my insatiable appetite for
    learning, and my unwavering enthusiasm for new challenges. I especially
    thrive when collaborating on creative solutions with other curious minds.
