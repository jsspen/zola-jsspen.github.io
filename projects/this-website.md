This website was made using <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola" target="_blank">Zola</a>, a static site generator written in Rust. The design took a <a href="https://github.com/janbaudisch/zola-sam" target="_blank">port</a> of the Hugo theme <a href="https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam" target="_blank">Sam</a> as a starting point but has been heavily edited into what you see here.

Pages were written in CommonMarkdown with some inline HTML. Templating was written in <a href="https://keats.github.io/tera/" target="_blank">Tera</a>. Styling was written in SASS. Push-based deployment is managed by GitHub actions.
