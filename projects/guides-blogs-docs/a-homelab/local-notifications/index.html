    <h2 id="local-notifications">Local Notifications</h2>
<p>While I've done a lot of work to set up various monitoring services, those aren't all that useful when I'm away from my computer. One thing that had been on my to-do list for a while was setting up local notifications. In the past I have used Telegram bots (I've written more about that <a href="">here</a>), and though those worked well enough I just didn't love relying on an outside service like Telegram, especially with more sensitive notifications and alerts.</p>
<h3 id="ntfy">ntfy</h3>
<p>One name I had seen frequently while researching was <a href="https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy">ntfy</a>. While it can be nice to have software with all kinds of bells &amp; whistles, I was drawn to the simplicity of ntfy. It's a basic HTTP-based pub-sub service that can be easily plugged in to all manner of applications. Importantly for my needs and interests it's fully open source, easily self-hostable, and has an open-source Android app (bonus points for offering the app via F-Droid!).</p>
<p>While ntfy is offered as a Docker image I have been trying to use LXC's when possible, so I threw one together with the help of a tteck script and dug in. Upon opening the IP:Port in my browser I was immediately greeted with a "notifications not supported" message! No HTTP allowed! At this point in my experience this is a trivial problem (I've written more about that <a href="">here</a>) so I ran through my ususal process...</p>
<p>First I popped over to Nginx Proxy Manager and created a new proxy host for a new ntfy subdomain. I set the IP and port to forward, assigned it my standard domain SSL certificate (a Let's Encrypt cert using DNS Challenge 01), flipped on the "force SSL" and "HTTP/2 support" toggles, and saved it. Then its over to my Pi-Hole instance to create a local DNS record pointing the ntfy subdomain to my NPM IP.</p>
<p>Now for a little editing of the ntfy config (located at <code>/etc/ntfy/server.yml</code>). I needed to set the <code>base-url</code> to the new HTTPS address I just set up and to set <code>behind-proxy</code> to <code>true</code> but I also wanted to make a few other changes, namely setting up notification caching. At the moment I'm not exposing <em>any</em> of my services to the open internet, so there are likely to be some times where I'm inaccessible (maybe I'm out of the house and forget to turn on Wireguard) and I certainly don't want to miss out on any notifications. I'm also curious about some of the more extravagent notification options that ntfy supports so I set up a cache directory for attachments, too.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>base-url: &quot;https://ntfy-subdomain.maindomain.xyz&quot;
</span><span>cache-file: &quot;/var/cache/ntfy/cache.db&quot;
</span><span>cache-duration: &quot;12h&quot;
</span><span>behind-proxy: true
</span><span>attachment-cache-dir: &quot;/var/cache/ntfy/attachments&quot;
</span><span>attachment-total-size-limit: &quot;500M&quot;
</span><span>attachment-file-size-limit: &quot;100M&quot;
</span><span>attachment-expiry-duration: &quot;24h&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>I save my config, reboot the LXC, and head to the new address in my browser. No more error message! I open the app on my phone and subscribe to a new topic, which is as simple as making one up! I enter <code>test</code> and check the box for "use another server" (the default is the public ntfy server) and I enter mine. Back in my browser I click "publish notification," enter <code>test</code> as the topic name, and enter a little bit of nonsense in the title and message fields. A click on send and <em>ding</em> there it is on my phone. Simple!</p>
<p>I did notice that the app was telling me that it would be better if I connected via websocket. I tapped "enable" and my <code>test</code> subscription fell into the pit of endless "reconnecting..." so I was definitely going to have to do a little more than just click enable! Turns out, not much more: NPM has a toggle switch for "Websockets Support" when configuring a proxy host. Now I was back in business - though with a new note jotted down: learn about websockets.</p>
